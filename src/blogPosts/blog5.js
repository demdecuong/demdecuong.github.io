    <p>APCS - Advanced Program of Computer Science of University of Science in Ho Chi Minh City</p>
    I am a student of APCS (K17) with threshold score and graduate late 2 years due to english certificate, that's a long journey because I am not keen on English.

    <p>Overview of this program: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> 80 students across the nation (actually its about 100 students for 2 clasess) </li>
      <li> Tution fee: 40 mil per year (in my year 2017) </li>
      <li> Nearly 50% are forward recruited from gifted school </li>
      <li> The curriculum is borrowed by high-ranked CS program (csranking) but it has been reduced its comprehensive about 20-40% </li>
      <li> Teacher's background is solid in Vietnam </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Pros and Cons of this program:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pros:
        <ul>
          <li> Body in there are excellent </li>
          <li> No stricky and hard test, teach A, the test would be A+ </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cons:
        <ul>
          <li> No application coding -> Software is not really solid </li>
          <li> High cost</li>
          <li> High competitive </li>
          <li> Not a magic pill to become a great engineer. You still have to work really hard. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    What I actualy learned from this program:
    Hmmm :) The people. They teach me to dream big, follow excellent standard and broaden my vision. Some are in Google, Axon, .etc. Some continue pursuiting PhD in top-tier university (Standford, Rice, .etc). If not like 1% , most of them are kind people, solid engineer in their working space. 
    Even they are not engineer, they understand theirshelves deeply and follow their dream bravely, ples them. 
    Ye, understand yourshelves is the most challenging journey in life.
    I am proud to be a partner with them for a period of time. I am proud to be a member of APCS.
